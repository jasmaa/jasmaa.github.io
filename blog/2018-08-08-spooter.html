  <p>Fresh out of the Nerdy Nights Pong tutorial, I had vowed never to write any
assembly for the NES ever again.</p>

<p>As you can guess, that didn’t happen.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>While on vacation visiting my grandparents, I found out about a game jam called
Floppy Jam. The gimmick of the jam was that all entries must theoretically
fit on the 1.44MB alloted to a floppy disk, hence the name of the jam.
Naturally, this meant that most orthodox game engines would not meet the cut as
they create too much overhead.</p>

<p>This also meant that I was down to only a few options if I chose to participate:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Finally learn OpenGL and pray that I can write something in C/C++</li>
  <li>Hack a thing together with various JS libraries and a canvas</li>
  <li>Go back to NESASM hell</li>
</ol>

<p>I might also mention at this point that my grandparents have limited access to
the Internet, and being on vacation, I wanted to see sights, not screens.
So, with a few cached NESDev wiki pages and the 6502 instruction manual in hand,
I jumped back into the fray of writing really bad assembly code.</p>

<h2 id="process">Process</h2>

<p>For the longest time, I had dreamed of making an even shittier version of
Hong Kong 97, a bootleg SNES game starring Jackie Chan vs China. While this was the
impetus for the project, Spooter very quickly morphed into a traditional space shooter.</p>

<p>Starting off, I copied the Pong basecode I had written following Nerdy Nights
last year, leaving a lot of the hardware shenanigans intact while deleting just
enough Pong functionality for the assembly to still compile and run. After
fiddling a little bit more with the code, I managed to get a space ship sprite
to load and went from there.</p>

<p>One of the greatest hurdles in designing Spooter was controlling groups of objects
(lasers, aliens, explosions). Initially, I thought this could be done naively by
hardcoding the functionality of every object individually. However, as I started
adding functionality for the aliens, this readily became infeasable.
As you might expect, since every alien
needed to be checked against every laser, I would be re-writing upwards of 12
blocks of code. This kinda ticked me off. I had avoided anything too complicated
before this, but now I braced myself for the inevitable and wrote what may be
called in the most primitive sense, a “nested for-loop”. After somehow
successfully doing that, I started to get into the groove of things and began
navigating and building a jungle of jumps, loops, and register juggling, even
working in a system of activating and deactivating groups of objects with a
bitmask where the bits in a byte would dictate active members of a group (so
a bitmask of 00001001 would mean that the 4th and 1st object were active).</p>

<p>By far, the largest time sink with NESASM was fixing bugs. Often this was a slip-up
like forgetting to load newly-added sprites or writing to the wrong area of memory.
Other times, bugs were a result of inexperience with writing for the system such
as not knowing to turn off NMI before loading a new BG.</p>

<p>A few of these many endless gripes include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Labels that would occasionally get out of range. This was solved by hacking
  sections of code out and putting them into subroutines which worked somehow…</li>
  <li>More than enough bugs arose simply from bad math in hex and writing to the
  wrong addresses</li>
  <li>Nine-out-of-ten, a bug somehow got fixed by clearing/setting the carry bit</li>
  <li>For the longest time, I thought I was bit-shifting right when I was really
  going left</li>
  <li>The score is an 8-bit value and, as such, will overflow once the player gets
  a score of 256. This will remain a feature that I now dub, “Spaceship
  Reincarnation”</li>
  <li>The game over screen is made of BG tiles and flickers since the only working
  method I have of writing to the background is turning off NMI, writing to an
  address, and turning it back on…</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the finished game. The final product ended up being a relatively simple
shoot ‘em up where enemy floppies would float down, get shot, and respawn
ad infinitum.</p>

<h2 id="after-thoughts">After Thoughts</h2>

<p>Several goals remain unaccomplished for this project.</p>

<p>For one, I had wanted to add music and sound-effects into the game but lack of experience
with the APU and time made this a hard endeavor. Another early dream was also to
parallel the boss of Hong Kong 97 with a large boss made of BG tiles. This was
also not possible due to a lack of experience.</p>

<p>The box art was also drawn up in MSPaint in the literal hour immediately
after the game’s completion and leaves much to be desired.</p>

<p>Here it is in all its glory.</p>
