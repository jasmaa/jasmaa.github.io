  <p>This past year, I’ve been trying to get into DDR. One thing led to another,
however, and instead of getting good at dancing, I ended up dissecting my soft
pad instead.</p>

<p>I first got into the game since it seemed like the next logical jump for me. I
played a lot of Bang Dream and osu! in the past, so I felt like DDR would be
another rhythm game I could easily pick up. Plus I don’t get enough exercise, so
I was also planning to use this as a motivator to move around more.</p>

<p>The easiest way to play DDR on a PC is through
<a href="https://www.stepmania.com/">StepMania</a>, an open-source DDR clone. I downloaded
it and a few song packs, and once I had gotten the hang of the game on the
keyboard, I felt it was time to move to a real dance pad. Scouring the Internet,
I ended up deciding on a D-Force soft pad for reasons I don’t particularly
remember. After getting the pad and some head-banging with the controller
settings (I didn’t realize I had to download <a href="https://joytokey.net/en/">Joy2Key</a>
to map the controller to keyboard inputs), I eventually got it connected to
StepMania and was up and grooving away.</p>

<h2 id="things-fall-apart">Things Fall Apart</h2>

<p>That lasted about a month. At some point, the pad’s right button stopped
responding consistently. At first, I chalked it up to my foot just missing the
button (I found out I’m actually pretty bad at DDR once I started using the
pad). However, after playing more maps, it slowly dawned on me that the pad was
actually broken.</p>

<p>“Okay, maybe this one was just defective.”</p>

<p>I returned the pad and got it replaced. However, the next one only lasted for
two weeks before the down button ran into the exact same problem. Frustrated, I
rolled up my pad up into a corner and ended up quitting the game for nearly a
month.</p>

<h2 id="open-pad-surgery">Open Pad Surgery</h2>

<p>Eventually MLK day rolled around. Desiring the dance floor once again, I dusted
off the pad and began taking it apart. My plan was simple: the D-Force pad has a
matrix of  9 buttons. I’ve mapped 4 to hit arrows in the game and 1 to confirm
selections. This left the remaining 4 buttons unused. If I could re-wire one of
these unused buttons to the controller’s down button input, then everything
would be solved!</p>

<p>Opening up the pad, I found two plastic sheets coated with some sort of
conductive paint separated by a layer of foam. The foam layer has a bunch of
holes where each button is. It seems that the pad works by getting the circuits
of the two layers close enough to each other in order for electricity to flow
between the two sides. When I flipped the pad around, I noticed that the plastic
sheet on the bottom had a crease in the bus line leading to the down button.
Suspecting that this to be the cause of my woes, I grabbed some scissors and
scotch tape and began the operation.</p>

<p>The plan was to cut out both the down button portion and the unused bottom right
button portion of the plastic sheet. Then I was going to install the bottom
right button as the new down button with the help of some tape and extra
conductive components that I cut out.</p>

<p>This is what it ended up looking like, all said and done (buttons are flipped
horizontally since this is the bottom sheet).</p>

<p>I stacked all the layers up and stapled my frankenstein pad together. Loading up
a song in StepMania, I apprehensively started to play, and to my surprise, it
seemed to be working.</p>

<h2 id="the-relapse">The Relapse</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, this time of love and joy did not last very long. Later in the
night, as I was playing a longer session, the down button became unresponsive
again. I removed the staples and opened up the pad once again to a new mystery.</p>

<p>However, this time, I intended to use a more scientific method in my
investigation instead of just flat intuition. I busted out my multimeter and
started to measure parts of the circuit. Multimeters have a mode called <a href="https://www.fluke.com/en-us/learn/blog/digital-multimeters/how-to-test-diodes">“diode
test”</a>
which is really useful for seeing if there is an electronic connection between
two points or not. The multimeter displays a voltage drop if there is a
connection, otherwise it just displays a “1” which means that the circuit is
overloaded. When I pointed the terminals at the down button and its bus line, I
got a 1. It seemed like my first fix did not last very long (whoops). Just as a
sanity check, I also tested the connection between the down button and other
buttons. Since they wouldn’t form a circuit with the multimeter, I got a 1 as
expected.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fixing-a-d-force-pad/IMG_3287.jpg" alt="Dance pad circuits after button replacement" /></p>

<p>In an attempt to fix the connection, I ended up cannibalizing a larger piece of
the leftover down button and attaching it higher in the down button’s bus line.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fixing-a-d-force-pad/IMG_3283.jpg" alt="Dance pad circuits after button replacement" /></p>

<p>Measuring again, the voltage drop was pretty bad, but at least there’s some connection now.</p>

<p><img src="/images/fixing-a-d-force-pad/IMG_3285.jpg" alt="Dance pad circuits after button replacement" /></p>

<p>I slapped the button a few times with Joy2Key running, and it seemed responsive
again, so I sandwiched the sheets back together again and returned to stomping
on them for the rest of the night.</p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>Since then, the D-Force pad has been working quite smoothly. I suspect it will
break again in the future, but at least I know how to fix it now. I still wish I
had a more reliable dance pad, but basically the next upgrade I could get is a
<a href="https://www.maty-taneczne.pl/shop/dance-mat-ltek-ex-pro-2/">$400 hard pad from
Poland</a>. I’m not
that invested into the game yet, so I figure I’ll make do with my current setup
for now.</p>

<p>Overall, this was an interesting experience. I don’t know much about hardware,
so even learning a small thing like how to use a multimeter in a practical
situation feels like a big step up to me. That being said, the outcome was
definitely more satisfying than the journey on this one. After all, I’ve finally
fixed my pad! Now there is nothing to do but dance (or fail miserably trying to
do so)!</p>
