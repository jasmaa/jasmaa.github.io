  <p>One of my CS classes this semester runs a semester-long contest
to see who can write the fastest concurrent maze solver. Submitted
programs are tested on a battery of 7 mazes that may or may not be solvable and a public scoreboard
is updated quasi-daily with each competitor’s runtime performance on all the mazes
as well as their rank and score. With such a treasure trove of data before
my eyes, I could not resist and set out to run some analysis on it.</p>

<h2 id="parsing-and-cleaning-the-data">Parsing and Cleaning the Data</h2>

<p>As it is, the scoreboard is simply an HTML table on a web server which needed to be
parsed. The good news is that this part of the project was already done.
I had been working on a separate project before this to visualize the data
from our contest and had been regularly parsing and saving snapshots
of the scoreboard with a Cloudflare Worker for a few weeks already, so
getting the data was a simple matter of downloading the latest snapshot
my worker had saved. However, my worker stores the scoreboard snapshots as serialized JSON objects
which are not too convenient for running statistics on. I ended up writing
a small Python script to transform all the data into a CSV, ending up
with the following table:</p>

<p>At this point, the data still needed to be cleaned. Not all programs
on the scoreboard ran correctly for all mazes, so these entries needed
to be filtered out. Since these failing entries also caused the columns
end up with non-numerical data,
each maze column and the score column also had to be be converted to
numerical data.</p>

<p>Filtering the data brought the number of entries from 155 down to 132 points.
Now that we had some pretty clean data, it was time to dive into some statistics!</p>

<h2 id="maze-runtime-statistics">Maze Runtime Statistics</h2>

<p>Exploratory data analysis was first performed on the data. This consisted of
graphing a histogram and generating some statistics for the runtimes of
all 7 mazes.</p>

<p>In general, it seems that mazes with greater average runtimes
displayed greater standard deviations. This is probably because mazes
with greater runtimes are likely larger, unsolvable mazes. This means more variability
in how programs may proceed with searching the maze over time and thus more variability in the
amount of time a program would take to solve the maze or determine that it is unsolvable.</p>

<p>Despite this, the histograms and standard deviations
seem to show that, overall, there is not too much spread in the
runtimes for each maze amongst competitors. This seems to indicate that most programs
are performing quite similarly to each other on all of the mazes.</p>

<p>While these histograms give a good initial look at the runtimes,
it also divorces each program from its performance on all 7 mazes
as a whole. To see how each competitor’s program was related to one another, we
need to cluster the data.</p>

<h2 id="clustering-the-competition">Clustering the Competition</h2>

<p>To make the clusters, each competitor’s maze runtimes was treated as a 7D
vector with the runtime for each maze occupying a dimension. The vectors were
fed into K-means with 3 centroids which gave the following:</p>

<p><img src="/images/maze_contest/clusters.png" alt="Graph of competitors by cluster" /></p>

<p>The PCA summary shows that the first two PCs capture about 87% of the variance
so the transformation still retains most of the information from when the points
were in 7D.</p>

<p>From here, we can begin to characterize our 3 clusters:</p>

<h4 id="cluster-1-gotta-go-fast">Cluster 1: Gotta Go Fast</h4>

<p>Cluster 1 consists of 5 points that are spread decently far apart.
The cluster’s center shows faster runtimes compared to all other centers
on each maze except maze 2.</p>

<p>Overall, this group seems to be comprised of the fastest programs. Due to their
spread, the creators of these programs probably took different approaches from each other to design
but ultimately still managed to create programs that were able to out-perform most
of the other solvers on most of the mazes.</p>

<h4 id="cluster-2-most-of-us">Cluster 2: Most of Us+</h4>

<p>Cluster 2 is the largest cluster at 126 data points and also the most densely
clustered with only 6 points deviating significantly from the main blob. Compared
to the cluster 1 center, cluster 2’s center displays about 2-5x slower runtimes with
the greatest difference being in the maze 3 performance (1.96s vs 10.59s).</p>

<p>Almost all of the submitted programs fall in cluster 2 and nearly all of those
fall within the main blob. This seems to support the earlier observation
from the histograms that most programs in the contest perform very similarly. While the
performances of most programs are similar, it is difficult to say whether this
similarity in performance is because of similar implementation or because
most of us were hitting the same barriers to improvement despite having different methodologies.</p>

<h4 id="cluster-3-pluto">Cluster 3: Pluto</h4>

<p>The final cluster consists of a single data point, so nothing can be said
about spread within the cluster. The centroid cluster shows similar maze performance
to that of cluster 2 with 2-4x slower runtimes on mazes 1, 2, 4, and 5.</p>

<p>While this point is far from the cluster 2 blob, it is only the tip of the iceberg.
There are 23 failing programs that were initially filtered out and not
considered in this analysis. If we had included those data points, setting each
point’s missing runtimes to an arbitrarily large value, the graph might have instead
shown a fan of points stretching out beyond this one.</p>

<h2 id="closing-remarks">Closing Remarks</h2>

<p>Ultimately, the data analysis yields a very boring conclusion: most everyone is about the same. While we
do have a few outliers, they do not amount to many;
over 70% of the class is contained within a single, dense blob.</p>

<p>I also haven’t mentioned how programs are ranked. While you would think it’s based on
<strong>fastest average time</strong> across all mazes, it’s actually based on <strong>smallest cumulative rank</strong> across all
mazes. A competitor’s rank for each maze is summed with smallest summed value corresponding to highest ranker.
This means that even if your program significantly out-performs everyone else’s on a large maze, if
it is not optimized for a small maze and runs 0.1 seconds slower than everyone else’s, you
are ranked last for that maze and drop rank significantly. Ultimately, this means that while
our clustering says something about the performance of the programs, it does not say much
about their ranking in the contest. While many members of cluster 1 are also high rankers,
being in cluster 1 does not guarantee high rank.</p>

<p>Of additional note is that this analysis is only based on a snapshot of the scoreboard at around the time of
writing. The contest runs until the end of the semester, and we are free to improve our programs however
we like. It is very possible for the clusters and rankings to change as competitors find smarter and leaner ways to
solve mazes. Perhaps the everyone blob will scatter; perhaps we will all end up in cluster 1. Only time
will tell, but until then, let the maze solver tournament arc continue!</p>
