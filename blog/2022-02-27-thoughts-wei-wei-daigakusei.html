  <p>I had previously written a separate post briefly talking about Yabai T. Most of
their songs don’t have English translations, so I thought I would try my best to
translate them and talk a bit about what I learned in the process. I’ve also
been wanting to keep up with my Japanese, so it’s a win-win. To preface this
post (and the rest of them if they come): I’m a hobbyist. I’m missing a lot of
linguistic and cultural experience relating to Japan. I’ll try my best, but the
translations are not going to be or even aiming to be perfect. This is mostly a
learning exercise for me. Anyways, onto the fun stuff!</p>

<p>First on the chopping block is <em>Wei Wei Daigakusei</em> which was released in 2016
as part of Yabai T’s album, <em>We love Tank-top</em>. The song describes a group of 5
college students in the Kansai area living a rowdy and free life instead of
studying hard at school. While the premise isn’t exactly unique, Yabai T frames
it with a uniquely Kansai spin, including a few callouts to locations that have
ties back to Osaka and the Kansai area in general.</p>

<h2 id="translation-notes">Translation Notes</h2>

<p>The first few lines of <em>Wei Wei Daigakusei</em> mention two phrases, 産近甲龍
(sankinkouryuu) and 関関同立 (kankandouritsu). These are both acronyms for two
groups of famous private universities in the Kansai area.</p>

<p>Sankinkouryuu:</p>
<ul>
  <li>San: Kyoto Sangyo University</li>
  <li>Kin: Kinki University</li>
  <li>Kou: Kounan University</li>
  <li>Ryuu: Ryuukoku University</li>
</ul>

<p>Kankandouritsu:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kan: Kansai University</li>
  <li>Kan: Kwansei Gakuin University</li>
  <li>Dou: Doshisha University</li>
  <li>Ritsu: Ritsumeikan University</li>
</ul>

<p>The Sankinkouryuu are a group of 4 semi-elite universities while the
Kankandouritsu are a group of 4 elite universities. All 8 are considered quite
prestigious and tough to get into though, hence their notability. Of course,
these rankings are just for Kansai private universities. Kantou has their own
pyramid of prestigious private schools, although I was not able to find
definitive information about exactly which ones they were. Beyond these
pyramids, there are even more elite schools since Japanese public universities
are viewed as more prestigious than private ones. The schools making up what
were the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_Universities">imperial
universities</a> would
probably be considered the most prestigious in the nation.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Later on, the song also mentions 鳥貴族 (torikizoku) which is a famous izakaya chain.
Torikizoku originated in Osaka but has spread out around Hyogo and Tokyo. It
appears their specialty is chicken skewers as well as other izakaya fare like
alcohol and small bites. Naturally, no Torikizoku exist in the US as far as I’m
aware, but the abundance of chicken skewer photos I found both on their Twitter
and on other various English-language blogs has started to make my mouth drool.
If I ever get the chance to visit Osaka down the line, I’m going to check them
out.</p>

<p>Another location mentioned is the スポッチャ (supoccha) or Spo-cha, a
portmanteau of the words “sports” and “challenge.” Spo-cha is an indoor,
all-you-can-eat (play?) sports complex aimed at both adults and children offered
at various Round 1 entertainment centers. They seem to offer a wide variety of
activities, from traditional sports like basketball and soccer, to more
unorthodox activities like go-kart and full-body-inflatable-ball-thing(?). Some
US Round 1’s also have Spo-cha as well with nearly the same list of activities
which means this is something that I could realistically try out someday.</p>

<h2 id="closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Wei Wei Daigakusei</em> was one of my favorite Yabai T songs, even before I dived
into the translation, purely based on its tune and theme. There’s something
amusing about a high-energy song featuring a bunch of college students going all
out with their lives. It also spoke to something that I wish I had during
college. Like many others, I spent the latter years of uni stuck at home because
of the pandemic. Being able to listen to a fun song about college students and
pretend I was with them having a fun campus life during that time was a bit
therapeutic in a way.</p>

      <p>Not every imperial university was in today’s Japan since the Empire of
Japan had territory outside of the modern-day country. Two of them actually
became the modern-day National Taiwan University and Seoul National
University, both of which are still very prestigious. It’s interesting to
trace how the past, whether positive or negative, ends up shaping the future
like this. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
