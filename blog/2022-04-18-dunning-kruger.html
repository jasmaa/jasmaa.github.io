  <p>I recently read a <a href="https://economicsfromthetopdown.com/2022/04/08/the-dunning-kruger-effect-is-autocorrelation/">blog
post</a>
arguing that the Dunning-Kruger effect was not a psychological phenomenon but,
rather, a statistical artifact.</p>

<p>For some context, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger
effect</a> is a
well-known cognitive bias discovered and discussed by David Dunning and Justin
Kruger in a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10626367/">1999 paper</a>. In short,
the idea of the effect is that poor performers tend to overestimate their
ability while skilled performers tend to underestimate their ability. The effect
seems to have received wide-acceptance over time due to the ease with which
their results have been reproduced in other areas. It also kind of just makes
sense anecdotally; a lot of us have either been or seen that overconfident
person learning a new subject.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the blog post referenced above strongly pushes against the
psychological conclusions of Dunning and Kruger’s results, making the argument
that the Dunning-Kruger effect is actually a statistical artifact. The general
idea from that post is that Dunning and Kruger’s results only arise because we
are trying to correlate some random variable, X, with a function of itself, Y-X.
In the case of Dunning-Kruger, X were test scores subjects scored, and Y were
test scores subjects <em>think</em> they scored. Y-X is the discrepancy between the
predicted and actual scores which were observed to have trended downwards as
subjects went from overestimating to underestimating as skill increased.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dunning-kruger/dk_figure.png" alt="Dunning-Kruger chart from paper" /></p>

<p>The author argues that because of the way these calculations were designed, we
are guaranteed to observe some trend between the two variables we are comparing
(X vs Y-X) due to the inherent correlation that exists between them rather than
because there is some psychological effect at play (e.g. humans overestimating
their abilities). The author then goes on to provide an experiment and some
graphs to support his point.</p>

<p>This seemed like a very reasonable explanation, but I still had trouble
accepting that the DK effect that many others, including myself, have taken to
heart was just the result of some statistics. I wanted to try and recreate the
author’s experiment and see it with my own eyes. Plus I wanted to see if I still
had it in me to write some R.</p>

<h2 id="an-experiment">An Experiment</h2>

<p>We needed to setup a scenario with two independent random variables, X and Y (I
ended up just making them standard normal distributions). Dunning and Kruger
broke their participants up into quartiles based on their test scores, so I have
done the same on the X variable.</p>

<p>After this, I calculated the averages for X and Y by quartile. R treats the
quartiles as factors, so I also needed to convert them to a numeric vector.</p>

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now it’s time to make some graphs.</p>

<p>These are what the data points looked like. X and Y were not correlated, so
graphing them just creates a cloud of points. X and Y-X have a negative
correlation, so we see a downwards trend with some noise (produced by Y).</p>

<p><img src="/images/dunning-kruger/y_vs_x.png" alt="Y vs X" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/dunning-kruger/y-x_vs_x.png" alt="Y-X vs X" /></p>

<p>After the data points were grouped by quartile, I graphed a boxplot for each
quartile. Since X is correlated with itself, the averages in the boxplots
display a linear trend moving across quartiles. On the other hand, since X and Y
are not correlated at all, the boxplots in each quartile look about the same
compared to each other.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dunning-kruger/x_by_quartiles.png" alt="X by quartiles" /></p>

<p><img src="/images/dunning-kruger/y_by_quartiles.png" alt="Y by quartiles" /></p>

<p>Graphing only the averages in each quartile and combining the graphs, we finally
see something that is eerily similar to both what the author of the blog post
and what Dunning and Kruger produced.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dunning-kruger/x_and_y_by_quartiles.png" alt="X and Y averages by quartiles" /></p>

<p>This graph roughly shows the correlation of X and Y to X (since the quartiles
are just X split by group). The black line increases over the quartiles because
X is effectively being graphed against X. Meanwhile, the red line appears flat
since, because Y has no correlation with X. In each X quartile, the distribution
of Y values remains roughly the same (quartiles 1 and 4 just represent fewer
points since the probability of landing at the tails of a normal distribution is
less likely).</p>

<h2 id="a-statistical-artifact">A Statistical Artifact</h2>

<p>The idea of DK being a statistical phenomenon is not new. The Dunning-Kruger
effect Wikipedia page outright states that one of the criticisms for the
Dunning-Kruger effect is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean">regression to the
mean</a>.</p>

<p>One idea from regression to the mean is that after an initial sampling,
performing a second sampling from the most extreme data points will still result
in a mean that is close to the mean from the initial sample. For example,
suppose I am interested in the distribution of test scores on a randomized
true-false exam. If I made 100 students take a randomized true-false test, the
expected mean score is 50%. If I then took the top 10 students from the 1st exam
and made them take a different randomized true-false test, the expected score on
the 2nd exam is still 50%. Since the answers are randomized, even though I took
the top performers and made them take another test, the mean from the second
testing is not extreme but, rather, still close to the mean from the first
testing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dunning-kruger/regression_to_mean.png" alt="Regression to the mean with first test and second test with top-scorers" /></p>

<p>This is roughly what is happening with our experiment. We performed an initial
sampling of a distribution (X) and broke the data points into quartiles where
the 1st and 4th quartiles could be considered “extreme” data points. We then
performed a second sampling on the same distribution (Y) and calculated the
averages per group. Due to regression to the mean, the averages of Y look the
same across all groups of X, despite some groups being more extreme than others
in terms of X. This is because, in each group, the group averages of Y are
regressing towards the overall mean of Y.</p>

<p>The real world implication is that, perhaps, the scores people get and the
scores people guess they got have a discrepancy, not because of a difference in
mental models between poor and skilled performers, but because these two
variables are not really related at all. And why should they be related? All we
know is that some people are very good at whatever test they took, not that they
can make good judgments on how well they did.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-does-it-all-mean">So What Does It All Mean?</h2>

<p>Do the Dunning-Kruger effect and its psychological conclusions really exist or
not? I used to believe so, that it was because most people new to a field were
overconfident, but after running this experiment, I’m not so sure. Maybe we all
just suck at judgment. Even if a person is good at taking a test, what incentive
(other than maybe avoiding hubris) do they have to accurately assess how well
they did? When we self-assess our ability, how do we know that we aren’t just
randomly picking numbers from a distribution in our head and that we are
actually making a grounded and logical analysis?</p>

<p>Of course, when I questioned all of this to a friend, all they said was, “You’re
thinking about this too much. People are just overconfident. I’ve seen them.”</p>

<p>And perhaps they are right. Dunning-Kruger effect or not, psychologically-based
or statistically-based, humans are still humans, one more unique than the next.
One can use broad experiments to draw conclusions about data points overall, but
it doesn’t mean you’ve discovered something about how an individual acts. I
suppose the only real way to do that is to go out there and talk to some folks.</p>
